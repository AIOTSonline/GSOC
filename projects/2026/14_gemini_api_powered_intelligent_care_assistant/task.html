    <h1>Entry Task — Gemini-API–Powered Intelligent Care Assistant</h1>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Assess basic skills in structured prompt design, data ingestion, simple summarization, and role-aware filtering.</p>

    <h2>Task (small & focused)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create a small script that ingests a CSV of simple IoT activity events (timestamp + event type) and produces a short natural-language summary for one-day activity (2–5 sentences).</li>
      <li>Show one example of role-aware filtering (e.g., produce a summary for a "caregiver" vs a "relative" that differs in detail level).</li>
      <li>Include the prompt(s) you used (or a mocked Gemini call) and a README explaining how to run the script.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub repo link with the script and README</li>
      <li>Sample input CSV and sample outputs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>We evaluate clarity, reproducibility, and thoughtfulness about role-aware and ethical constraints. This task is intentionally small to check for awareness and design sense.</p>
