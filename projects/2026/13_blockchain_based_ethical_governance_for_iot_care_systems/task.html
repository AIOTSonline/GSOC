    <h1>Entry Task — Blockchain-Based Ethical Governance</h1>

    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>Assess basic familiarity with smart contracts, consent modeling, and simple off-chain verification.</p>

    <h2>Task (small & focused)</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Implement a minimal Solidity smart contract that allows: registering consent (grant), revoking consent, and querying the current consent state for an identifier.</li>
      <li>Create a short test or script that demonstrates registering and revoking consent (Hardhat tests, Truffle, or Remix + simple script).</li>
      <li>Provide a README with setup instructions and a short explanation (2–4 paragraphs) of how this contract could be used as an audit layer in an IoT care system.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Deliverables</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>GitHub repo link with the contract, tests, and README</li>
      <li>Optional: a short 1–2 minute demo video or GIF showing the test run</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>We evaluate correctness, clarity of code, and thoughtfulness in the README. This task is intentionally small — we want to see awareness and correct design choices, not a production system.</p>
