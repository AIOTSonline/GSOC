    <div class="section-title">Description</div>
    <div>Implement MQTT support for the Catrobat language in Catroid (Pocket Code and its flavors) so Catrobat programs can publish/receive network messages for multiplayer games, IoT, and Home Assistant setups. Add two new Catrobat bricks (activated via app settings):<br><br>
    <b>Broadcast … via MQTT on channel …</b><br>
    <b>When you receive a message via MQTT on channel … store it in …</b><br><br>
    Broker/TLS/auth/client-id are configured globally in app settings, and connect/subscribe happen lazily to avoid boilerplate (wildcard channels should store channel+message as JSON). Provide example projects for two multiplayer architectures:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>one phone acting as a local hub (extending the existing Bluetooth multiplayer variables concept)</li>
      <li>a dedicated hub over local Wi-Fi (e.g., Mosquitto) coordinating multiple players</li>
    </ul>
    Also provide a Home Assistant-oriented topic convention under catrobat/... enabling wall-tablet dashboards and home automations (Tuya/Smart Life and other Home Assistant-supported hardware).<br><br>
    Ensure reliability (reconnect/offline handling) and strong automated tests for core logic (especially topic-filter matching and message routing).</div>
