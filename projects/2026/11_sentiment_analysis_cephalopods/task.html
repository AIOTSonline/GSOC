    <div class="desc">
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>The goal of this entry task is to assess an applicant’s basic readiness for a research-oriented project: data handling, simple feature extraction, reproducibility, and the ability to reason about behavioral signals. This task is intentionally small and exploratory.</p>

      <h2>Task Description</h2>
      <h3>Data handling</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Select a short video clip (10–30 seconds) of an aquatic animal (cephalopod preferred).</li>
        <li>Load the video using Python and report frame rate, resolution, and duration.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Feature Extraction</h3>
      <p>Implement any two simple, interpretable features (choose two):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frame-to-frame motion magnitude (frame differencing or optical flow)</li>
        <li>Area or extent of movement over time</li>
        <li>Color or intensity histogram changes across frames</li>
        <li>Approximate contour size or bounding-area variation</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Visualization</h3>
      <p>Plot the extracted features over time and include at least one visualization that plausibly supports behavioral interpretation (e.g., low vs high activity periods).</p>

      <h3>Short Analysis</h3>
      <p>Write a 5–10 sentence explanation describing what behavioral information the selected features may capture, key limitations, and how additional modalities (audio, posture) could improve inference.</p>

      <h2>Submission Format</h2>
      <p>Publish a public GitHub repository containing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Source code (Python script or Jupyter notebook)</li>
        <li>Any small sample data used, or clear instructions to obtain it</li>
        <li>A README with setup instructions, a short description of implemented features, and sample plots/screenshots</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Evaluation</h2>
      <p>Evaluated on correct data handling, code clarity, quality of reasoning, and reproducibility. Advanced models or large datasets are not required.</p>
