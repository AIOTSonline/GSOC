    <h1>Entry Task</h1>
    <div class="desc">Applicants were asked to create a simple AR simulation of a marine ecosystem, demonstrating basic food chain interactions and at least one dynamic environmental effect (e.g., pollution, temperature change). The task was evaluated on technical implementation, creativity, and clarity of explanation.</div>
