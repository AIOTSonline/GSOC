    <div>This project will focus on developing AI-powered 3D models of marine species using generative AI techniques. By training machine learning models on marine biology datasets, realistic and interactive 3D assets of octopus, fish, corals, and other underwater species will be created for use in AR applications for teaching marine biology in high schools, where teachers and pupils will be able to “program” the simulated marine animals for learning purposes integrated into biology curricula. These models will adapt dynamically based on environmental conditions like depth, temperature, and biodiversity levels.</div>
