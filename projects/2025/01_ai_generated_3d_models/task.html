    <h1>Entry Task</h1>
    <div class="desc">For this project, applicants were required to demonstrate the ability to generate 3D models using AI techniques and integrate them into a simple AR or 3D viewer. The task included training a basic generative model (or using a pre-trained one), exporting a 3D asset, and providing a short demo of the workflow. The focus was on code quality, reproducibility, and clarity of documentation.</div>
